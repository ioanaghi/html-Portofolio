<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Ioana-Teodora Ghineț, a passionate Computer Science student at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, currently honing my skills in programming, software development, and artificial intelligence. My academic journey, supported by a strong background in Mathematics and Informatics from "Gheorghe Vrănceanu" National College, has shaped my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
</p>
<p>I have experience with C++ and C programming, as well as proficiency in tools like Photoshop, Lightroom, and Microsoft Office. My curiosity for technology has driven me to participate in various competitions, such as the Polihack and Coderun, where I earned third place in app development using Flutter. Additionally, I reached the semifinals in Innovation Labs 2024 with the ElectriGo app, showcasing my creativity and dedication to innovation.
</p>
<p>Alongside my technical skills, I thrive in teamwork, adaptability, and communication, skills I have developed through my volunteer work with organizations like OSUT and LEO Alpha Bacau. I have also enjoyed contributing as an organizer in digital oratory contests and as an ambassador for film festivals.
</p>
<p>My passion for learning extends beyond technology, with interests in volleyball, playing the piano, and singing, all of which keep me balanced and driven in both my professional and personal life.</p>
