<h1>The Best Movies According to Ioana
</h1>
<h2> My top Disney movies of all times</h2>
<hr />

<h3> Descendentas 1 </h3>
<p> This movie appeared in 2015 and I fell in love with the music and the story.</p>

<h3> Descendentas 2 </h3>
<p> This movie appeared in 2017 and I loved Carlos's Dog.</p>

<h3> Descendentas 3 </h3>
<p>This movie appeared in 2019 and I was just liking the franchise as a whole.</p>

<h3> Descendentas 4 </h3>
<p> This movie appeared in 2024 and since Carlos a.k.a Cameron Boyce has died it would have been understandable not to continue dis series of movies, but they did. <br />
    Only 2 actors from the original movie came back and they tried to pay omage to Carlos, but I feel like it could have been named in another way since the characters didn't appear in it.</p>
